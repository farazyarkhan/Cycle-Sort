Cycle Sort:
Cycle sort is a in-place & unstable sorting algorithm. it divides the array into cycles to perform sorting.
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) while the time complexity is O(n)

Working:
It works by comparing the pivot(first element) with other elements and counts smaller elements and swaps it with its correct position.

Input:
Works fine for every integer input (positive, negative, sorted and unsorted)

Ouput: 
Shows the unsorted array on the console followed by the sorted array.
The sorted output will always be in ascending order.
